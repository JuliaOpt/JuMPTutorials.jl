Since we want to test the tutorials using Travis CI and run them in the browser using Binder, we should always try to go for the solver which works out of the box with just a Package install. In case this is not possible, do not add the tutorial to the runtests.jl file and add a line that it does not work with Binder. Note that this issue is not specific to solvers and may arise with other Julia packages as well.","category":"page"},{"location":"notes/#Tangle","page":"Notes","title":"Tangle","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"notes/","page":"Notes","title":"Notes","text":"We use the tangle feature of Weave.jl to generate files for testing as it allows us extract code from a file.
